                   We explore the intersection between human emotion and intelligent systems. Our research in Affective Computing focuses on designing technologies that can recognize, interpret, and simulate emotional states to foster more natural and empathetic interactions between humans and machines.

                    We aim to develop computational models that not only understand affective signals such as facial expressions, voice tone, and physiological responses but also respond in emotionally intelligent ways. These models are applied in diverse contexts, including:

Supporting caregivers and decision-makers in dementia care environments
Enhancing virtual agents with human-like emotional behavior
Creating immersive 3D simulations for affective interaction testing
Our Intelligent Systems research line focuses on the design and development of software platforms, virtual agents, and AI systems capable of operating autonomously, learning from their environment, and collaborating effectively with humans in complex tasks.
