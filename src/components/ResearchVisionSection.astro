        ACISLAB operates at the intersection of Affective Computing,
        Intelligent Systems, Software Engineering,
        and Human-Computer Interaction.

      <p>
        Unlike purely data-driven or “black-box” AI approaches,
        our research emphasizes formal, explainable, and methodologically
        grounded models of cognition and emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        We develop Computational Models of Emotion, study how
        emotional processes influence cognition and decision-making,
        and design architectures for cognitive and affective agents
        capable of interacting naturally with users.
